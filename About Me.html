    Where I grew up:
     <blockquote>
    <p>
     I grew up in Kingston Jamaica in the Papine District for most of my life. Since Basic School until Primary School, that is when I went to America for a year. I left and went to Florida for the majority of 6th grade then relocated to Georgia for the last three month of that school year. Then I came back for highschool. I have been studying in Jamaica ever since.
